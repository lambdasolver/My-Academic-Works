>[!def] Definition (Integrally Closed)
>If $A$ is a subring of $B$ and [[Integral Closure]] of $A$ in $B$ is $A$ then $A$ is called integrally closed in $B$

>An [[Integral Domain]] is said to be [[Integrally Closed]] if it is integrally closed in its [[Field of Fractions]]

 >Any [[Unique Factorization Domain]] is integrally Closed
